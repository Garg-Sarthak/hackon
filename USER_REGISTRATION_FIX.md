# User Registration Fix

## Problem Identified
The user registration check was flawed and only checked Supabase auth, not the custom users table. This caused issues where:

1. Users who signed up with social login (Google, GitHub) showed as "registered" even though they weren't in the custom users table
2. Users without passwords were considered "registered" 
3. The system couldn't distinguish between fully registered users and partial social login users

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Backend Endpoint
Added `/api/check-user-registration` endpoint in `server.js` that:
- Checks if user exists in the custom `users` table
- Returns proper registration status based on database presence
- Only considers users "registered" if they exist in the custom table

### 2. Updated Frontend Authentication Service
Modified `checkAccountExists()` function in `authService.js` to:
- Use the new backend endpoint instead of just checking Supabase auth
- Return `true` only for users who are properly registered in the custom database
- Provide accurate registration status

### 3. Added Comprehensive Status Function
Created `getUserRegistrationStatus()` function that provides detailed information about:
- Whether user exists in Supabase auth
- Whether user exists in custom users table  
- Overall registration status (fully_registered, partial_registration, not_registered)
- Helpful status messages for debugging

## How This Fixes The Issue

**Before:**
- `checkAccountExists()` returned `true` for any user in Supabase auth
- Social login users without passwords showed as "registered"
- No distinction between full registration and partial social signup

**After:**
- `checkAccountExists()` returns `true` only for users in the custom users table
- Social login users who haven't completed registration show as "not registered"
- Clear distinction between different registration states

## Testing
1. Users who signed up with email/password and exist in custom table: ✅ Shows as registered
2. Users who used social login but aren't in custom table: ❌ Shows as not registered  
3. Users who don't exist anywhere: ❌ Shows as not registered

## Next Steps
- Test the sign-in/sign-up flow to ensure it works correctly
- Verify that social login users complete the registration process properly
- Ensure the `/api/personalized` endpoint works with proper user records

The registration check now accurately reflects whether a user is truly registered in your system, not just whether they have a Supabase auth account.
